# Stage 5: Reusable Code Review Skill

## Deliverable
A reusable `code-review` skill with SKILL.md, review script, and smoke test.

## Skill vs Tool vs Prompt vs MCP

| Concept | What It Is | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Tool** | A callable API endpoint | `read_file(path)` returns file contents |
| **Prompt** | A one-shot instruction | "Review this code for bugs" |
| **Skill** | A reusable workflow with steps, scripts, templates, and acceptance criteria | This code-review skill |
| **MCP** | A protocol to connect external tools/data sources | Jira MCP server for ticket access |

A Skill is **more than a prompt**: it has:
- Defined trigger conditions ("when to use")
- Step-by-step workflow
- Supporting scripts and templates
- Acceptance criteria for success
- A smoke test to verify it works

## Skill Structure

```
code-review-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Skill definition (name, description, when to use, steps, acceptance criteria)
└── review.py         # Entry point script with smoke test
```

## How to Run

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv

# Smoke test (verifies the skill works - tests SQL injection and hardcoded credential detection)
python review.py --smoke-test

# Review a file
# 在 .env 中配置 MIMO_BASE_URL, MIMO_API_KEY, MIMO_MODEL
python review.py src/auth.py

# Review with specific focus (security, bug, style, performance)
python review.py src/api.py --focus security
```

## Review Output Format

The review produces a structured JSON output with:
- **issues**: Array of findings with severity (critical/warning/info), category, line number, description, and suggestion
- **summary**: Files reviewed, issue counts by severity, overall quality rating

## Smoke Test

The smoke test verifies:
1. API connectivity to MiMo model
2. JSON output parsing
3. SQL injection detection in test code
4. Hardcoded credential detection in test code
